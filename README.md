An example of a completion of a pretty typical interview test/ kata for converting integers into the british string equivalent.

Written in C#.

# Code Test

Take a number and give the equivalent number in British English words e.g.

 * 1 = one
 * 21 = twenty one
 * 105 = one hundred and five
 * 56945781 = fifty six million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and eighty one

etc. up to 999,999,999 without using a tokenizer, or any external libraries.

 4.	application of patterns to solve the problem
 5.	no code duplication
 6.	well refactored code


As a pointer on what we would be looking for in the app:

 1. application of good OO design principles to solve the problem
 2. well tested code
 3. well refactored code
 
A procedural approach to this code is strongly discouraged.
